   - Document management providers
   - AI service providers
   - Settings and preferences providers

### Short Term (1 week)
1. **Core Features Implementation**
   - User authentication flow
   - Document CRUD operations
   - Basic text editor with markdown support
   - AI assistant integration (basic chat)

2. **UI/UX Polish**
   - Implement all designed screens
   - Add loading states and error handling
   - Responsive design for different screen sizes
   - Accessibility improvements

3. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for business logic
   - Widget tests for UI components
   - Integration tests for API communication
   - End-to-end testing

### Medium Term (2-4 weeks)
1. **Advanced Features**
   - Real-time collaboration
   - Document version history
   - Advanced AI features (writing suggestions, grammar checking)
   - File import/export (PDF, DOCX, markdown)

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Database query optimization
   - Frontend bundle optimization
   - Caching strategies
   - Image optimization

3. **Production Readiness**
   - Environment-specific configurations
   - Database migrations system
   - Monitoring and logging
   - Security hardening

### Long Term (1-3 months)
1. **Platform Expansion**
   - Web version (Flutter Web)
   - Desktop apps (Flutter Desktop)
   - PWA capabilities
   - Mobile app store deployment

2. **Advanced AI Features**
   - Custom AI model fine-tuning
   - Document templates with AI generation
   - Intelligent content suggestions
   - Multi-language support

3. **Business Features**
   - User management and teams
   - Subscription and billing
   - Analytics and insights
   - Third-party integrations
